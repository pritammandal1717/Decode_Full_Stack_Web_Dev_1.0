// Q7. You are building a weather application. Write a JavaScript program that takes the current temperature
// as input and uses the conditional (ternary) operator to determine and print the weather condition. 
// If the temperature is above 30Â°C, the condition is "Hot"; otherwise, it is "Moderate".

let temperature = 11;
let weather = temperature > 30? "Hot" : "Moderate";
console.log(`Weather is now ${weather}`);
