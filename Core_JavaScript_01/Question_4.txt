Q4. Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.

Answer:
    In JavaScript, the comma operator (,) allows you to create a compound expression where 
    we have multiple expressions being evaluated. The comma is used to separate each expression.

        Example:
                In JavaScript, we can write - 

                    show = (console.log(1), console.log(2), console.log(3), 4);

                Output:
                    1
                    2
                    3
